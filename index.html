                <h2> What Makes the Story? </h2>
                <p> When it comes to industry-leading innovations in mopeds and accessories, 
                    Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for to complete your story.</p> 
                    
                <p >We sell top-quality mopeds and equipment locally and abroad for years. </p>

                <p> Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have 
                    been copying us for some time.</p> 
                    
                <h3> The Dont's</h3>
                <p>Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal.</p>

                <p> Don't settle for second best when it comes to your moped dreams and don't feel you have to raid your savings. 
                    Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust in, at a price you can afford.</p> 
                
                <p> Don't feel that we are not stoked to have you as part of our family.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>Custom work is another thing entirely, we can customize to your hearts content and make your dream ride come true. </strong></p> 
                    
                <p> At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're 
                    interested in discussing a fully custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.</p>

                <p> Or since you are already here, play around for a bit and see who we are and if we are cool enough for you!</p>
